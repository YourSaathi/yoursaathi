YourSaathi is an anonymous Counselling platform for women. It provides a safe place for women to share their problem and helps them cope up quickly. It provides counselling by our certified counsellors without revealing their identity.

It will provide them with a social platform where they will have someone to listen to their problem without judging them. They will have a feeling of belongingness and will be at ease. Generally, going to a psychiatrist is often regarded as a shameful act which resists people to share their feeling openly. Hence, YourSaathi will act as a catalyst in overcoming this social stigma.
