Hello Ladies üëß!!

From ancient times until the present, Women are often harassed and exploited which has resulted in their under development and have somehow forced them to survive on the mercy of the thoughts and the judgments of the society. Women have always succeeded in adapting themselves into multiple roles, be it as a mother, wife or a daughter. However their remarkable contribution is often neglected and overlooked by society, this thus makes women feel isolated, incapable and sometimes incompetent as compared to their male counterparts.

Judging women as per the social dogmas is not the ONLY problem that women face. The emergence of the "so-called" developing world have made them the victim of rapes, domestic violence, social exclusion and even acid attacks. The increase in the frequency and the intensity of such offences contribute to the emergence of depression, anxiety and at an extreme end the "Suicidal Thought". Despite facing such severe phycological trauma, Women rarely share their problems with anyone, the reason being their fear of getting judged and the fear of getting their family reputation at stake by telling it to someone they know.

Depression is not a disease, it's not a problem it's inevitable, It can happen to anyone at any time.

It's like a headache, you think its another bad day, but it's not, you are stuck in that state of mind. You get used to by putting the social mask on your face. It feels like something terrible gonna happen and presented as the tightness in the chest, stomach ache and body gets shaky. It starts to feel heavy and started having obnoxious thoughts.

  
To deal with this problem we came up with YourSaathi, An Anonymous Counselling Platform for Women. It also provides a forum where women can discuss their problem in a group of people to help women who suffer from depression and anxiety in their day to day life.

  
YourSaathi has come up with this idea solely to help such women who have huge potential to succeed but are often misguided and find it difficult to return. My message to all such beautiful ladies out here is that: How difficult the situation be, just fight like a warrior and never let your stress and anxiety overpower your self-belief. Every problem has a solution but what is required is your inner faith and your belief in yourself to find that solution, and if somehow you find it difficult to come on to a most appropriate solution we as YOURSAATHI is always there to help you out. So just live that smile on your face and make us your forever Saathi üíú.
